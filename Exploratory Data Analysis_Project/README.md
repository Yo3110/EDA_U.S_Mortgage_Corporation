# U.S. Mortgage Exploratory Data Analysis Project - Excel, SQL, POWER BI, PYTHON

## Overview

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) U.S. Mortgage Project repository! This project is a comprehensive exploration of U.S. mortgage data, employing a multi-step approach for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. The key tools utilized include Microsoft Excel for initial data cleaning, SQL for manipulating and extracting data from a database, Power BI for visualization and pattern discovery, and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for enhancing data visualizations.

## Project Objectives

Data Cleaning with Microsoft Excel: Utilize Microsoft Excel for initial data cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring the dataset's readiness for analysis.

SQL Data Manipulation: Leverage SQL to manipulate and extract relevant information from the database, allowing for seamless integration of various datasets.

Power BI Visualization: Utilize Power BI to create interactive and insightful visualizations, enabling a dynamic exploration of mortgage data patterns.

Python Enhancement: Apply Python, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, for advanced data analysis and visualization, enhancing the depth and detail of insights
